Works in the environment ld-env

The script get_ld_from_vcf.sh takes as input chromosome and positions, filters the vcf and gets a square r matrix with plink.
Currently does this for: GBR, EUR, YRI and AFR (this can be changed quite easily in the scripts). 
Example use: bash ../scripts/get_ld_from_vcf.sh 7 117120079 117308719

The script filter_matrix_allpops.py makes the task more manageable by excluding all rows whre the MAF for a SNP is zero. 
Should be run from the directory where the files are. 
Example use: 
module load python
python ../../scripts/filter_matrix_allpops.py

The script plot_r_allpops.py plots a matrix of r, and plots the mean allele frequency versus r for randomly sampled pairs of SNPs. 
Should be run from the directory where the files are. 
python ../../scripts/plot_r_allpops.py

The script plot_corrprob_allpops.py plots correlation probabilities for the region specified, splitting it into 10 chunks (by number of SNPs). 
python ../../scripts/plot_corrprob_allpops.py 

And as a joint frequency visualisation for the two SNPs:
python ../../scripts/plot_joint_corr.py 

ANNOTATIONS:
I annotate using annovar (downloaded February 2023)
The two scripts which carry this out are run_annovar.sh (prepares vcf and runs annovar) and combine_annovar.sh (combines results into one txt file). Should be run from the results directory.

bash ../../scripts/run_annovar.sh
bash ../../scripts/combine_annovar.sh

I also have a script which plots a kind of heatmap between functional annotations, where colour is the mean r
python ../../scripts/plot_annotation_table.py 
and one for each contiguous annotation set:
python ../../scripts/plot_annotation_table.py
